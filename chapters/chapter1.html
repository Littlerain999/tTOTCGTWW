                    <p>The first rays of dawn touched the quiet streets of Eryndor, the kingdom that sat on the edge of the world, untouched by the conflicts of the stronger nations. In the stillness of the morning, a child played in the dirt, his small hands shaping imaginary castles in the earth. His innocent laughter filled the air, a sound so pure it seemed to harmonize with the breeze.
                    </p><br>
                    <p align="center"><i>Then, it happened.</i></p><br>
                    <p>A shard—a strange, glowing fragment—fell from the heavens, landing with a soft thud at the boy's feet. The child stopped, staring at the shard with wide, curious eyes. The air grew heavier, the peace of the morning disturbed. The boy reached down to pick it up, the shard cold to the touch, its surface shimmering with an unknown energy. He looked up toward the sky, confusion turning to unease as he tried to understand where it had come from. <br>There was nothing. No sign of the shard's origin. Only the endless blue of the morning sky.

                    </p><br>
                    <p>His voice cracked through the silence, high-pitched and filled with panic.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>His mother, still inside their modest home, rushed to the door, hearing the fright in her son's voice.</p><br>
                    <p><b>Mother [Worried and rushing outside]:
                    </b> "What is it, my boy?"
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Her eyes followed his trembling hand as he pointed to the sky. The villagers, drawn by the child's scream, emerged from their homes, gathering in the street, whispering among themselves. The boy's finger remained fixed, trembling in the air. Slowly, the people's gazes followed his hand, and then—there it was.</p><br>
                    <p align="center"><i>The sky above them was breaking.</i></p><br>
                    <p>A vast crack split the heavens open, jagged and violent, tearing through the fabric of the world. The light of the sun faltered, swallowed by the dark void that now loomed above them.</p>

                    <p>The mother clutched her child, her heart racing in her chest.

                    </p><br>
                    <p>The air thickened with an unsettling silence, and the people stood frozen, unable to speak, unable to move. The world seemed to hold its breath. <br>From within the void, a figure began to emerge—bright, luminous, and blinding. It descended from the rift, its light so intense it forced every eye to look away, yet no one could tear themselves from the sight. The figure hovered above them, its presence overwhelming, as if it came from a place beyond time and understanding.</p><br>
                    <p><b>Child [Voice trembling, filled with awe and fear]: 
                    </b>"Mama... it's here."<br>No one could move. No one could speak. The people of Eryndor—so used to their quiet, simple lives—stood paralyzed in awe and fear as the figure, a being of unimaginable light, slowly descended from the heavens.

                    <p>The earth beneath their feet seemed to tremble, the very air thick with an unspoken power. <br>The figure that emerged from the crack in the sky was none other than Yue—her presence radiated with an ethereal glow, as if she was both part of the heavens and the earth itself. She stepped forward, each movement slow and deliberate, like the unfolding of time itself. <br>But as she took another step, a woman from the crowd screamed. Her eyes wide with terror, she crumpled to the ground, fainting from the sight of the figure above. Panic spread like wildfire. People in the streets began to run, rushing into their homes, slamming doors behind them in haste.</p><br>
                    <p><b>Yue [Calm, observing the chaos around her]:
                    </b> "Oh... I made a terrible mistake."
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Her gaze softened as she watched the frightened faces of the people, realizing the fear she had unintentionally caused. A small frown tugged at her lips.</p>
                    <p><b>Yue [Self-reflective, speaking softly to herself]: </b>"I think... I've arrived at the place where my beloved would be born, but I didn't carefully choose the place, did I? No humans, no distractions... and yet, here I am."</p>

                    <p>With a gentle exhale, she closed her eyes, and a wave of power pulsed through her. A bright flash of light exploded from her form, filling the streets and blinding the citizens of Eryndor. For a brief moment, time seemed to stand still. The air crackled, as if the world itself was holding its breath. <br>When the light faded and the villagers could once again see, the sky had returned to its peaceful, unbroken state. The crack was gone, and everything had returned to normal. A heavy sigh of relief echoed through the crowd. The villagers exchanged confused glances, unsure of what had just transpired, but grateful to be unharmed. <br>And then, as if a weight had been lifted, laughter and music filled the air as they celebrated their narrow escape. Dancing, they reveled in the joy of survival, their earlier fear now forgotten in the face of their own resilience.</p>

                    </p><br>
                    <p>Blending seamlessly into the crowd, her heart beat faster with anticipation. The journey had just begun, and her beloved awaited.

                    <p>The entire world trembled with the surge of unimaginable power that rippled across the continents. Yue's arrival, though subtle in its moment, caused a great disturbance, a pulse that could be felt by all—but none knew its source. The very fabric of the world quivered under the weight of this unknown force, and yet, no one could trace where it had come from.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>The people of the world, from the human kingdoms to the demon lands, found themselves gripped by confusion and fear. The skies above seemed unnaturally still, as if waiting, holding its breath for something that had already begun. Whispers spread like wildfire, carried on the wind, and rumors swirled through taverns and courts alike.</p><br>
                    <p>In Valoria, the capital of the strongest human kingdom, the wise and powerful King looked out over the horizon, feeling the disturbance in his bones. The Heroes' descendants, the proud lineage that had protected the kingdom for generations, were not easily swayed. They were soldiers, kings, and scholars of great power. Yet, this unknown presence stilled the very air around them.</p>

                    </p><br>
                    <p>He turned to his advisors, his eyes cold and unyielding. The power that surged had shaken his kingdom to its core, and he would not rest until it was controlled or destroyed. With a swift command, he ordered an elite group of soldiers to be assembled—ones that were trained not only in combat but in the ancient magic of their ancestors. They would search the world, tracing the source of this disturbance, no matter the cost.</p><br>
                    <p><b>Valorian King [Angry, resolute]:

                    <p>Across the sea, in the depths of Malakar, the central kingdom of the demon world, the Demon King's descendants also sensed the great power that had surged. Deep within the obsidian walls of the Malakar palace, the air was thick with dark energy. The descendants of the Demon King were known for their power and ruthlessness, and they, too, would not allow an unknown force to threaten their reign.

                    <p>The Demon King's heir, his eyes flashing with fury, clenched his fists. He, too, felt the disturbance, and like the Valorian King, he suspected the arrival of something—or someone—that opposed the laws of the world. It was not enough to simply understand the cause; it had to be eradicated. No one would defy the gods' teachings without consequence.</p><br>
                    <p><b>Demon King's Heir [Cold, commanding]:

                    <p>With a single snap of his fingers, he, too, dispatched an elite force of warriors and sorcerers, charged with the task of finding the source of this mysterious surge of power and bringing it to an end.

                    <p>In the Feralden mansion, a sense of anticipation hung thick in the air. The entire household was caught up in the excitement of the arrival of the second child of the house. Preparations were underway, but little did the family know, the crack in the sky that had occurred earlier had gone unnoticed by those within the mansion, consumed by the joy of the birth. <br>Inside the birthing room, Lady Mirena Feralden's scream echoed through the halls, signaling the arrival of her second child. Lord Aldric Feralden, pacing nervously outside the door, anxiously ran his fingers through his hair. He glanced over at his first son, Gaius, who stood by his side with a mix of concern and impatience.</p><br>
                    <p><b>Lord Aldric Feralden: [scratching his head, voice laced with worry] :

                    </b>"You're right, Gaius. But this is different. She's carrying our second child. I can't help but feel a little... powerless."</p><br>
                    <p>The tense moments dragged on, but soon, the sound of the door creaking open broke the silence. A nurse emerged, her face beaming with excitement.
                    </p><br>
                    <p><b>Nurse: [smiling brightly]

                    <p>At the news, both father and son's faces lit up with relief and joy. Without another moment's hesitation, Lord Aldric Feralden hurried into the room, with Gaius trailing closely behind. <br>Inside, Lady Mirena sat on the bed, holding their newborn son in her arms, a soft smile of pure love and joy gracing her face. The glow in her eyes was unmistakable as she gazed lovingly at the child.

                    <p>He embraced his wife warmly, his heart overflowing with pride and joy. The couple exchanged soft words of congratulations and sweet nothings, marveling at the new life they had brought into the world. In that moment, everything felt right, as if all the struggles and worries of the outside world had faded away.</p><br>

                    <p>As they gazed down at their son, the world outside seemed distant, unaware of the powerful forces in motion. The crack in the sky, the strange surge of power that had been felt across the world, all of it seemed irrelevant in this moment. </p>

                    <p>Her eyes followed his trembling hand as he pointed to the sky. The villagers, drawn by the child's scream, emerged from their homes, gathering in the street, whispering among themselves. The boy's finger remained fixed, trembling in the air. Slowly, the people's gazes followed his hand, and then—there it was.</p><br>
                    <p align="center"><i>The sky above them was breaking.</i></p><br>
                    <p>A vast crack split the heavens open, jagged and violent, tearing through the fabric of the world. The light of the sun faltered, swallowed by the dark void that now loomed above them.</p>

                    <p>The air thickened with an unsettling silence, and the people stood frozen, unable to speak, unable to move. The world seemed to hold its breath. <br>From within the void, a figure began to emerge—bright, luminous, and blinding. It descended from the rift, its light so intense it forced every eye to look away, yet no one could tear themselves from the sight.

She stepped forward, each movement slow and deliberate, like the unfolding of time itself. <br>But as she took another step, a woman from the crowd screamed. Her eyes wide with terror, she crumpled to the ground, fainting from the sight of the figure above. Panic spread like wildfire. People in the streets began to run, rushing into their homes, slamming doors behind them in haste.</p><br>

A bright flash of light exploded from her form, filling the streets and blinding the citizens of Eryndor. For a brief moment, time seemed to stand still. The air crackled, as if the world itself was holding its breath. <br>When the light faded and the villagers could once again see, the sky had returned to its peaceful, unbroken state. The crack was gone, and everything had returned to normal. A heavy sigh of relief echoed through the crowd. The villagers exchanged confused glances, unsure of what had just transpired, but grateful to be unharmed. <br>And then, as if a weight had been lifted, laughter and music filled the air as they celebrated their narrow escape. Dancing, they reveled in the joy of survival, their earlier fear now forgotten in the face of their own resilience.</p>

Whispers spread like wildfire, carried on the wind, and rumors swirled through taverns and courts alike.</p><br>
                    <p>In Valoria, the capital of the strongest human kingdom, the wise and powerful King looked out over the horizon, feeling the disturbance in his bones. The Heroes' descendants, the proud lineage that had protected the kingdom for generations, were not easily swayed. They were soldiers, kings, and scholars of great power. Yet, this unknown presence stilled the very air around them.</p>
