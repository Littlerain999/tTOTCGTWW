                    <p>The night after the sky-shattering incident, the kingdom buzzed with a mixture of tension and celebration. While the day's mysterious events had left many shaken, the joyous news of the birth of the young lord, Elias, quickly captured the people's attention. Whispers of hope and renewal spread like wildfire, reaching every corner of the land.</p><br>
                    <p>Lord Aldric Feraldens mansion became the center of festivities. Known for his fairness and respect for all, Lord Aldric extended invitations to nobles and commoners alike. It was a rare act of unity, and the gesture had not gone unnoticed.</p><br>
                    <p>The mansion gleamed under the glow of lanterns, their golden light illuminating the lush courtyard and the bustling streets beyond. Inside, music filled the grand hall, mingling with the clinking of glasses and bursts of laughter. Nobles dressed in elaborate silks stood in small, self-contained groups, their every gesture calculated. Meanwhile, commoners in their best attire admired the splendor around them, their faces a mix of awe and delight.</p><br>
                    <p>By the banquet table, a sudden crash shattered the harmonious scene.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="2">
                    <div class="page">2</div>
                    <p> A delicate glass, its surface etched with intricate patterns, lay in jagged shards on the floor.</p><br>
                    <p>“You clumsy fool!” A nobleman's voice rose above the chatter, sharp and accusing. His face, flushed with anger, turned toward a startled commoner standing nearby. “Do you have any idea how much that glass is worth?”</p><br>
                    <p>“I didn't touch it!” the commoner shot back, his voice trembling yet resolute. “You knocked it over!”</p><br>
                    <p>“Lies!” The noble's tone dripped with disdain as he pointed an accusing finger. “Your kind has no place among such finery.”</p><br>
                    <p>The air grew thick with unease as murmurs rippled through the crowd. Some nobles sneered, while a few commoners exchanged nervous glances.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>In the shadows, a cloaked woman observed the scene, her presence unnoticed. The faint flicker of lantern light caught the intricate patterns of the mask she wore, but her expression remained hidden. She silently observed the incident that unfolded infront her.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="3">
                    <div class="page">3</div>
                    <p>Before the argument could escalate further, the grand doors of the mansion swung open. Lord Aldric Feralden stepped into view, his imposing figure framed by the warm glow of light spilling from the hall. The crowd fell silent as his sharp gaze swept across the room, taking in the scene with quiet authority.</p><br>
                    <p>"Enough." His voice carried effortlessly over the gathering, calm yet commanding.</p><br>
                    <p>At his side, Lady Mirena stood with serene grace. Her presence seemed to soothe the rising tension, her gaze soft yet unyielding. She looked toward the commoner, her expression unreadable but kind, then shifted her focus to the nobleman, whose haughty demeanor faltered under her scrutiny.</p><br>
                    <p>Before either could speak, the sound of approaching hooves echoed through the courtyard. The heavy gates creaked open, revealing the royal wagon, its crest shining in the moonlight.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="4">
                    <div class="page">4</div>
                    <p>The crowd parted as the wagon came to a halt. Gasps rippled through the gathering as the King and Queen of Eryndor stepped out, their movements regal and deliberate. Their children followed, each poised and elegant.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Lady Mirena inclined her head in greeting, her voice carrying warmth and respect. “Your Majesties, welcome to our home. It is an honor to have you join us on this joyous occasion.”
                    </p><br>
                    <p>The King offered a measured nod, his expression calm but kind. “The honor is ours, Lady Mirena. Tonight, we celebrate not just a birth but the hope it brings to our kingdom.”
                    </p><br>
                    <p>As the royal family moved forward to greet the hosts, the earlier conflict dissolved, leaving only a lingering tension in the air. The cloaked woman, still hidden among the crowd, allowed herself a small, fleeting smile. Her gaze flickered toward the mansion's upper floors, where the faint cry of a newborn could be heard.</p><br>
                    <p>“My lord,” she whispered, her voice soft and reverent, “you have returned.”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="5">
                    <div class="page">5</div>
                    <p>As the lord and the royal family took their seats, the hall buzzed with quiet anticipation. Rising to his feet, Lord Aldric raised a gleaming goblet of wine. His voice, firm yet warm, carried through the grand hall. "Let the celebration begin!"</p><br>
                    <p>At his command, the mansion doors opened, and a parade of servants entered with practiced grace, balancing trays of wine and delicacies. The air filled with the sound of clinking glasses and lively chatter as the joyous atmosphere took hold.</p><br>
                    <p>In the corner of the hall, a cloaked figure in black observed silently. Yue, her face obscured by an intricately designed mask, remained unnoticed in the shadows. Beneath the mask, her vibrant amethyst eyes darted across the room, catching every movement. Despite the joy around her, her presence was subdued—a quiet guardian amidst the revelry.</p><br>
                    <p>After some time, Lord Aldric rose again, his commanding presence drawing attention once more. He raised his glass high. "I thank you all for gathering here today. This is a day of great joy, for today, my son Elias was born! Let us toast to the kingdom and to Elias!"</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="6">
                    <div class="page">6</div>
                    <p>A chorus of cheers erupted as glasses clinked, and a radiant wave of goodwill swept the room. However, the spirited celebration was soon interrupted by the faint sound of a baby's cry from the upper floors. Heads turned as the tiny, plaintive wail reached every ear.</p><br>
                    <p>Amused and intrigued, the crowd murmured among themselves, and some began to express a desire to see the young lord. Smiling with pride, Lord Aldric nodded. "It would be my honor to share this moment with you. Bring my son here!"
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Maids were swiftly dispatched to retrieve the little lord. Yue's eyes glimmered beneath her mask, her gaze fixed on the stairs with unshakable intensity. The faint, hopeful whisper escaped her lips, inaudible in the bustling hall. "My lord... finally."</p><br>
                    <p>She shifted slightly, her heart racing beneath the heavy fabric of her cloak. Yet, the faintest flicker of doubt crossed her face. "This body... it's still too unstable. Why now of all times? I should have prepared better. Five more days, and it would've been perfect." Her hands tightened slightly as she whispered with a bittersweet ache, "My lord, I miss you."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="7">
                    <div class="page">7</div>
                    <p>After a few moments, the maids descended the staircase carrying a cradle adorned with soft silks. Within it lay Elias, the little lord, fast asleep. The sight drew a collective sigh of admiration from the gathered guests. His peaceful expression, soft tufts of dark hair, and chubby hands peeking from beneath the blanket captured every heart.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Guests formed an orderly line, eager to catch a glimpse of the newborn. Each face softened with warmth and awe, and even the most stoic of nobles found themselves smiling. Yue watched from her shadowed corner, her hands trembling faintly. "So close," she murmured, her voice breaking with suppressed longing.</p><br>
                    <p>As the line of admirers thinned, Elias was carried to a quieter room away from the noise to ensure his rest. The noble children and the royal offspring expressed their desire to see the baby as well, but their mothers gently dissuaded them, fearing they might accidentally wake the little lord.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Among them, the five-year-old first princess of the kingdom lingered a moment longer than the rest. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="8">
                    <div class="page">8</div>
                    <p>Her piercing gaze, far too perceptive for her age, seemed to linger on the cradle. As if sensing something beyond the physical, she tilted her head curiously. "It feels like... there are two people in him," she whispered softly to herself, her tiny brow furrowing in thought.</p><br>
                    <p>Her steps faltered briefly before she turned to follow the other children, her curiosity still lingering but unspoken.</p><br>
                    <p>The night was drowned in the vibrant celebration, the faces of many alight with joy and laughter. But amidst the merriment, one person stood apart, her heart heavy with longing. Yue, unable to approach her lord due to the instability of her form, silently left the festivities with a sadness that shadowed her every step. She made her way through a quiet alley, her heart weighed down by the distance that still separated her from Elias.</p><br>
                    <p>With a breath, she soared high into the sky, her wings unfurling in the vast expanse above the kingdom. A spell of invisibility surrounded her, cloaking her presence from the world below. Slowly, the mask and cloak she wore vanished, her divine form revealing itself to the heavens.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="9">
                    <div class="page">9</div>
                    <p>Five pairs of wings shimmered in the moonless night, alternating in black as dark as the abyss and white as bright as the stars themselves. Above her head, an elegant crown appeared, a symbol of both grace and authority. The night sky stretched out before her, an ocean of darkness as the new moon shone not.</p><br>
                    <p>Yue's heart ached as she gazed up at the empty expanse. "The night is darkest without the moon," she whispered, her voice soft but filled with longing, "just as I am without you, my lord." Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears. "Even though it's only been a day since we parted, I miss you already."</p><br>
                    <p>A single tear slipped from her eye, falling to the earth below. As it touched the ground, the tear ignited with the power of her divine essence, transforming into an ethereal aurora that spread across the kingdom, painting the sky with vibrant colors. The sight was beautiful, but to Yue, it only deepened her sorrow.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="10">
                    <div class="page">10</div>
                    <p>The kingdom of Eryndor was left in confusion, some gazing in wonder, others in alarm. Only Yue remained untouched by the spectacle, her soul heavy with the desire to be reunited with her lord. She quickly concealed her wings and crown, shrouding herself in the cloak and mask once more, and flew back to Lord Aldric's mansion. Unseen by guards or servants, she made her way through the halls, her heart pounding in her chest as she approached Elias' room.</p><br>
                    <p>Standing before the door, Yue hesitated, the rush of emotions threatening to overwhelm her. But she had come this far. Slowly, she placed her hand on the door handle, the cool metal grounding her for a moment. She carefully checked the room, sensing no one else inside. With a nervous breath, she turned the handle and entered.</p><br>
                    <p>Her heart skipped a beat as her gaze fell upon the cradle where Elias slept peacefully. The sight of him—the little lord, her lord—stirred something deep within her. She placed a hand over her chest, feeling her heartbeat quicken with nerves and excitement. She slowly moved toward the cradle, pausing once more to take in the sight of her lord in his most innocent, pure form.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="11">
                    <div class="page">11</div>
                    <p>Kneeling beside the cradle, she reached out to gently poke Elias' cheek, but her hand froze midway. She suddenly realized her unstable form could harm him, and she quickly tried to retract her hand. However, before she could, Elias' tiny fingers grasped her finger, his eyes fluttering open. Yue's heart caught in her throat.</p><br>
                    <p>Startled, she tried to pull away, but Elias began to cry, a soft, pitiful sound that tugged at her heartstrings. Not knowing what else to do, Yue gently offered her finger once more, and Elias, still half-asleep, giggled and gave her a sweet smile. The warmth of his presence filled Yue with joy, and she realized that despite the reincarnation, her lord recognized her—perhaps not in full, but in spirit.</p><br>
                    <p>She removed her mask and gazed down at Elias with a warm, affectionate smile, her eyes shining with both joy and tears. Even as a little boy, Elias' reaction was one of awe, his face lighting up with wonder at her beauty.</p><br>
                    <p>Then, a sudden surge of dark energy poured from Elias' body, shocking Yue. Before she could comprehend the power, the energy flowed too quickly, entering her own body.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="12">
                    <div class="page">12</div>
                    <p>The divine essence she carried stabilized her form almost instantly. Her unstable body, once a burden, became strong and whole again.</p><br>
                    <p>Tears of relief welled in Yue's eyes as she realized the depth of her lord's power. She smiled gently, her heart overwhelmed with emotion. Leaning down, she kissed Elias' forehead, her lips soft and tender.</p><br>
                    <p>For a moment, they played together, laughing in the stillness of the night. The connection between them was undeniable, and for Yue, it was a moment of pure joy, a fleeting escape from the pain that had once gripped her.</p><br>
                    <p>But the peace was interrupted when Lady Mirena, Elias' birth mother, awoke from her sleep. Concerned for her son, she quietly made her way to his room. Her heart nearly stopped when she saw the figure in black near Elias' cradle.</p><br>
                    <p>"Who are you?" Lady Mirena asked, her voice cautious but not hostile.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="13">
                    <div class="page">13</div>
                    <p>Yue, startled by the question, turned slowly. As she saw Lady Mirena, the birth mother of her lord, a deep respect filled her. She bowed, her body lowered in reverence. "I apologize for intruding," she said softly. "I never intended to cause harm."</p><br>
                    <p>Lady Mirena, her heart racing, observed Yue carefully. Despite the cloaked figure's presence near her son, there was no malice in her demeanor, only a profound gentleness. The tension eased from Lady Mirena's chest as she turned to the cradle. Elias, now smiling up at Yue, reached out his tiny hands.</p><br>
                    <p>A soft gasp escaped Lady Mirena's lips as she watched the scene unfold. She looked back at Yue, but before she could speak further, Yue stood to leave, bowing once again.</p><br>
                    <p>"May your family remain blessed, my lady," Yue whispered, her voice full of warmth and respect. "And may my Lord and your son shine as the brightest light in this land."</p><br>
                    <p>Before Lady Mirena could respond, a white feather floated in front of her, blocking her vision. When it settled, Yue was gone, vanished as silently as she had come.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="14">
                    <div class="page">14</div>
                    <p>Lady Mirena, still processing the encounter, looked down at her son, finding him peacefully asleep with a contented smile on his face. The words "my Lord" echoed in her mind, a lingering mystery she couldn't quite shake.</p><br>
                    <p>Outside, the aurora that had painted the skies remained, casting a soft, mesmerizing glow over the kingdom. Lady Mirena's gaze lingered on the ethereal light before she returned her focus to her son.</p><br>

                    <p>And far away, Yue, smiling softly to herself, whispered under her breath, "I'll look forward to our days together in this life, my Lord."</p>

                    <p>“Lies!” The noble's tone dripped with disdain as he pointed an accusing finger. “Your kind has no place among such finery.”</p><br>
                    <p>The air grew thick with unease as murmurs rippled through the crowd. Some nobles sneered, while a few commoners exchanged nervous glances.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>In the shadows, a cloaked woman observed the scene, her presence unnoticed. The faint flicker of lantern light caught the intricate patterns of the mask she wore, but her expression remained hidden. She silently observed the incident that unfolded infront her.</p>

                    <div class="page">3</div>
                    <p>Before the argument could escalate further, the grand doors of the mansion swung open. Lord Aldric Feralden stepped into view, his imposing figure framed by the warm glow of light spilling from the hall. The crowd fell silent as his sharp gaze swept across the room, taking in the scene with quiet authority.</p><br>
                    <p>"Enough." His voice carried effortlessly over the gathering, calm yet commanding.</p><br>
                    <p>At his side, Lady Mirena stood with serene grace. Her presence seemed to soothe the rising tension, her gaze soft yet unyielding. She looked toward the commoner, her expression unreadable but kind, then shifted her focus to the nobleman, whose haughty demeanor faltered under her scrutiny.</p><br>
                    <p>Before either could speak, the sound of approaching hooves echoed through the courtyard. The heavy gates creaked open, revealing the royal wagon, its crest shining in the moonlight.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="4">
                    <div class="page">4</div>
                    <p>The crowd parted as the wagon came to a halt. Gasps rippled through the gathering as the King and Queen of Eryndor stepped out, their movements regal and deliberate. Their children followed, each poised and elegant.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Lady Mirena inclined her head in greeting, her voice carrying warmth and respect. “Your Majesties, welcome to our home. It is an honor to have you join us on this joyous occasion.”
                    </p><br>
                    <p>The King offered a measured nod, his expression calm but kind. “The honor is ours, Lady Mirena. Tonight, we celebrate not just a birth but the hope it brings to our kingdom.”
                    </p><br>
                    <p>As the royal family moved forward to greet the hosts, the earlier conflict dissolved, leaving only a lingering tension in the air. The cloaked woman, still hidden among the crowd, allowed herself a small, fleeting smile. Her gaze flickered toward the mansion's upper floors, where the faint cry of a newborn could be heard.</p><br>
                    <p>“My lord,” she whispered, her voice soft and reverent, “you have returned.”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="5">
                    <div class="page">5</div>
                    <p>As the lord and the royal family took their seats, the hall buzzed with quiet anticipation. Rising to his feet, Lord Aldric raised a gleaming goblet of wine. His voice, firm yet warm, carried through the grand hall. "Let the celebration begin!"</p><br>
                    <p>At his command, the mansion doors opened, and a parade of servants entered with practiced grace, balancing trays of wine and delicacies. The air filled with the sound of clinking glasses and lively chatter as the joyous atmosphere took hold.</p><br>
                    <p>In the corner of the hall, a cloaked figure in black observed silently. Yue, her face obscured by an intricately designed mask, remained unnoticed in the shadows. Beneath the mask, her vibrant amethyst eyes darted across the room, catching every movement. Despite the joy around her, her presence was subdued—a quiet guardian amidst the revelry.</p><br>
                    <p>After some time, Lord Aldric rose again, his commanding presence drawing attention once more. He raised his glass high. "I thank you all for gathering here today. This is a day of great joy, for today, my son Elias was born! Let us toast to the kingdom and to Elias!"</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="6">
                    <div class="page">6</div>
                    <p>A chorus of cheers erupted as glasses clinked, and a radiant wave of goodwill swept the room. However, the spirited celebration was soon interrupted by the faint sound of a baby's cry from the upper floors. Heads turned as the tiny, plaintive wail reached every ear.</p><br>
                    <p>Amused and intrigued, the crowd murmured among themselves, and some began to express a desire to see the young lord. Smiling with pride, Lord Aldric nodded. "It would be my honor to share this moment with you. Bring my son here!"
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Maids were swiftly dispatched to retrieve the little lord. Yue's eyes glimmered beneath her mask, her gaze fixed on the stairs with unshakable intensity. The faint, hopeful whisper escaped her lips, inaudible in the bustling hall. "My lord... finally."</p><br>
                    <p>She shifted slightly, her heart racing beneath the heavy fabric of her cloak. Yet, the faintest flicker of doubt crossed her face. "This body... it's still too unstable. Why now of all times? I should have prepared better. Five more days, and it would've been perfect." Her hands tightened slightly as she whispered with a bittersweet ache, "My lord, I miss you."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="7">
                    <div class="page">7</div>
                    <p>After a few moments, the maids descended the staircase carrying a cradle adorned with soft silks. Within it lay Elias, the little lord, fast asleep. The sight drew a collective sigh of admiration from the gathered guests. His peaceful expression, soft tufts of dark hair, and chubby hands peeking from beneath the blanket captured every heart.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Guests formed an orderly line, eager to catch a glimpse of the newborn. Each face softened with warmth and awe, and even the most stoic of nobles found themselves smiling. Yue watched from her shadowed corner, her hands trembling faintly. "So close," she murmured, her voice breaking with suppressed longing.</p><br>
                    <p>As the line of admirers thinned, Elias was carried to a quieter room away from the noise to ensure his rest. The noble children and the royal offspring expressed their desire to see the baby as well, but their mothers gently dissuaded them, fearing they might accidentally wake the little lord.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Among them, the five-year-old first princess of the kingdom lingered a moment longer than the rest. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="8">
                    <div class="page">8</div>
                    <p>Her piercing gaze, far too perceptive for her age, seemed to linger on the cradle. As if sensing something beyond the physical, she tilted her head curiously. "It feels like... there are two people in him," she whispered softly to herself, her tiny brow furrowing in thought.</p><br>
                    <p>Her steps faltered briefly before she turned to follow the other children, her curiosity still lingering but unspoken.</p><br>
                    <p>The night was drowned in the vibrant celebration, the faces of many alight with joy and laughter. But amidst the merriment, one person stood apart, her heart heavy with longing. Yue, unable to approach her lord due to the instability of her form, silently left the festivities with a sadness that shadowed her every step. She made her way through a quiet alley, her heart weighed down by the distance that still separated her from Elias.</p><br>
                    <p>With a breath, she soared high into the sky, her wings unfurling in the vast expanse above the kingdom. A spell of invisibility surrounded her, cloaking her presence from the world below. Slowly, the mask and cloak she wore vanished, her divine form revealing itself to the heavens.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="9">
                    <div class="page">9</div>
                    <p>Five pairs of wings shimmered in the moonless night, alternating in black as dark as the abyss and white as bright as the stars themselves. Above her head, an elegant crown appeared, a symbol of both grace and authority. The night sky stretched out before her, an ocean of darkness as the new moon shone not.</p><br>
                    <p>Yue's heart ached as she gazed up at the empty expanse. "The night is darkest without the moon," she whispered, her voice soft but filled with longing, "just as I am without you, my lord." Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears. "Even though it's only been a day since we parted, I miss you already."</p><br>
                    <p>A single tear slipped from her eye, falling to the earth below. As it touched the ground, the tear ignited with the power of her divine essence, transforming into an ethereal aurora that spread across the kingdom, painting the sky with vibrant colors. The sight was beautiful, but to Yue, it only deepened her sorrow.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="10">
                    <div class="page">10</div>
                    <p>The kingdom of Eryndor was left in confusion, some gazing in wonder, others in alarm. Only Yue remained untouched by the spectacle, her soul heavy with the desire to be reunited with her lord. She quickly concealed her wings and crown, shrouding herself in the cloak and mask once more, and flew back to Lord Aldric's mansion. Unseen by guards or servants, she made her way through the halls, her heart pounding in her chest as she approached Elias' room.</p><br>
                    <p>Standing before the door, Yue hesitated, the rush of emotions threatening to overwhelm her. But she had come this far. Slowly, she placed her hand on the door handle, the cool metal grounding her for a moment. She carefully checked the room, sensing no one else inside. With a nervous breath, she turned the handle and entered.</p><br>
                    <p>Her heart skipped a beat as her gaze fell upon the cradle where Elias slept peacefully. The sight of him—the little lord, her lord—stirred something deep within her. She placed a hand over her chest, feeling her heartbeat quicken with nerves and excitement. She slowly moved toward the cradle, pausing once more to take in the sight of her lord in his most innocent, pure form.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="11">
                    <div class="page">11</div>
                    <p>Kneeling beside the cradle, she reached out to gently poke Elias' cheek, but her hand froze midway. She suddenly realized her unstable form could harm him, and she quickly tried to retract her hand. However, before she could, Elias' tiny fingers grasped her finger, his eyes fluttering open. Yue's heart caught in her throat.</p><br>
                    <p>Startled, she tried to pull away, but Elias began to cry, a soft, pitiful sound that tugged at her heartstrings. Not knowing what else to do, Yue gently offered her finger once more, and Elias, still half-asleep, giggled and gave her a sweet smile. The warmth of his presence filled Yue with joy, and she realized that despite the reincarnation, her lord recognized her—perhaps not in full, but in spirit.</p><br>
                    <p>She removed her mask and gazed down at Elias with a warm, affectionate smile, her eyes shining with both joy and tears. Even as a little boy, Elias' reaction was one of awe, his face lighting up with wonder at her beauty.</p><br>
                    <p>Then, a sudden surge of dark energy poured from Elias' body, shocking Yue. Before she could comprehend the power, the energy flowed too quickly, entering her own body.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="12">
                    <div class="page">12</div>
                    <p>The divine essence she carried stabilized her form almost instantly. Her unstable body, once a burden, became strong and whole again.</p><br>
                    <p>Tears of relief welled in Yue's eyes as she realized the depth of her lord's power. She smiled gently, her heart overwhelmed with emotion. Leaning down, she kissed Elias' forehead, her lips soft and tender.</p><br>
                    <p>For a moment, they played together, laughing in the stillness of the night. The connection between them was undeniable, and for Yue, it was a moment of pure joy, a fleeting escape from the pain that had once gripped her.</p><br>
                    <p>But the peace was interrupted when Lady Mirena, Elias' birth mother, awoke from her sleep. Concerned for her son, she quietly made her way to his room. Her heart nearly stopped when she saw the figure in black near Elias' cradle.</p><br>
                    <p>"Who are you?" Lady Mirena asked, her voice cautious but not hostile.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="13">
                    <div class="page">13</div>
                    <p>Yue, startled by the question, turned slowly. As she saw Lady Mirena, the birth mother of her lord, a deep respect filled her. She bowed, her body lowered in reverence. "I apologize for intruding," she said softly. "I never intended to cause harm."</p><br>
                    <p>Lady Mirena, her heart racing, observed Yue carefully. Despite the cloaked figure's presence near her son, there was no malice in her demeanor, only a profound gentleness. The tension eased from Lady Mirena's chest as she turned to the cradle. Elias, now smiling up at Yue, reached out his tiny hands.</p><br>
                    <p>A soft gasp escaped Lady Mirena's lips as she watched the scene unfold. She looked back at Yue, but before she could speak further, Yue stood to leave, bowing once again.</p><br>
                    <p>"May your family remain blessed, my lady," Yue whispered, her voice full of warmth and respect. "And may my Lord and your son shine as the brightest light in this land."</p><br>
                    <p>Before Lady Mirena could respond, a white feather floated in front of her, blocking her vision. When it settled, Yue was gone, vanished as silently as she had come.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="14">
                    <div class="page">14</div>
                    <p>Lady Mirena, still processing the encounter, looked down at her son, finding him peacefully asleep with a contented smile on his face. The words "my Lord" echoed in her mind, a lingering mystery she couldn't quite shake.</p><br>
                    <p>Outside, the aurora that had painted the skies remained, casting a soft, mesmerizing glow over the kingdom. Lady Mirena's gaze lingered on the ethereal light before she returned her focus to her son.</p><br>
                    <p>Outside, the aurora that had painted the skies remained, casting a soft, mesmerizing glow over the kingdom. Lady Mirena's gaze lingered on the ethereal light before she returned her focus to her son.</p><br>
                    <p>And far away, Yue, smiling softly to herself, whispered under her breath, "I'll look forward to our days together in this life, my Lord."</p>
