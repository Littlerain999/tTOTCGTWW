                    <p>In the vast, starry expanse of the universe, where galaxies shimmered like diamonds on a dark velvet canvas, two celestial beings stood—one cloaked in black, the other in white. These beings, embodiments of opposite forces, were eternal partners—forever bound, forever intertwined.</p><br>
                    <p>The Black, known as the God of Destruction and Void, exuded an aura of infinite power and mystery. The White, the Goddess of Life and Creation, radiated warmth and divine grace. Together, they had existed for eons, reincarnating countless times, finding each other across lifetimes, and falling in love over and over again. Their bond was unbreakable.</p><br>
                    <p>Today, they stood hand in hand, gazing at the beauty of the universe they had shaped and ruled over, their love as unwavering as the stars themselves.</p><br>
                    <p><b>The White (softly, with a gentle smile):
                    </b>“My Dearest… how many times have we fallen for each other across the endless cycles of reincarnation? How many lives have we shared, hand in hand, heart to heart?”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="2">                
                    <div class="page">2</div>
                    <p><b>The Black (with a teasing grin):</b>“Ah, my love, I couldn't count the number of times we've crossed paths. And truth be told, I couldn't care less about the number. All that matters is you, The White, are always the one I desire above all.”</p><br>
                    <p>The White's face flushed pink as her heart swelled with affection. She turned to her eternal companion, her voice soft and filled with wonder.</p><br>
                    <p><b>The White (blushing, with a playful tone):
                    </b>“Oh, my King… forgive me for my curiosity. I wonder, how did I fall for you each time, in every life we've shared? How is it that I always find my way to you?”</p><br>
                    <p>The Black chuckled, his deep voice full of warmth, and leaned forward to kiss her forehead, his touch tender and full of affection.</p><br>
                    <p><b>The Black (teasingly):
                    </b>“Ah, my eternal love… shall we make a game of it? Perhaps in the next life, we'll see who falls for whom first. I shall reincarnate and wait for you to find me. It will be a test, my dear.”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="3">                
                    <div class="page">3</div>
                    <p>The White, still in his embrace, hesitated for a moment before pulling away slightly, her hands gently gripping his. Her expression grew serious, her eyes filled with longing.</p><br>
                    <p><b>The White (softly, with a touch of sadness):</b>“My Lord… I do not wish to be separated from you any longer. Not like this. Not in endless cycles of waiting. I cannot bear the loneliness of it.”<br>“I want to be with you in this life… from the very beginning. No more reincarnations, no more separations. Just you and I, together, forever.”</p><br>
                    <p>A tear shimmered in the corner of her eye, but she quickly wiped it away, trying to hide her vulnerability. <br>The Black's heart softened at the sight of her tears. He pulled her into a tight embrace, his voice filled with apology and tenderness.</p><br>
                    <p><b>The Black (gently):
                    </b>“My dearest goddess… forgive me. I have been thoughtless in my words. I have been selfish in my desire to play this game, but I now understand. I, The Black, promise to fulfill all your desires.”
                    “Tell me, my queen, what do you wish of me?”
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="4">
                    <div class="page">4</div>
                    <p>The White smiled softly, though her eyes still shimmered with unshed tears. She pushed him playfully away, her expression turning more serious again.</p><br>
                    <p><b>The White (with a gentle giggle):
                    </b>“You must keep your promise, my love. For now, I desire that you remain in your divine form, but I—”<br>“I wish to reincarnate into a human body. I will remain by your side from birth, watching you grow, seeing you become the man you are destined to be.”
                    </p><br>
                    <p>The Black's eyes widened slightly at her words, his face flushing with a mix of surprise and affection. He smiled, though, a little embarrassed by her unexpected request.</p><br>
                    <p><b>The Black (with a soft laugh):</b>“Very well, my dearest. If this is what you wish, I will honor it. The Black will do as you command, as always.”</p><br>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>A few moments passed in silence before the Black turned to her, his expression more serious as he spoke again.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="5">
                    <div class="page">5</div>
                    <p><b>The Black:</b>“The reincarnation process is about to begin. Before I go, tell me… what name should I call you in this life?”
                    </p><br>
                    <p>The White's eyes sparkled, a soft smile curving her lips as she thought for a moment.</p><br>
                    <p><b>The White:</b>“In this life, I shall be known as Yue. It is a name that reflects the moon, something eternal and constant, much like my love for you.”</p><br>
                    <p><b>The Black (with a smile):</b>“Then, my Yue, I will go now.”</p><br>
                    <p>They shared one last, passionate kiss, their embrace filled with a promise of love and reunion. The Black's form began to dissipate, leaving only a trail of sparkling stardust in his wake.
                    </p><br>
                    <p><b>The White (whispering softly to herself):
                    </b>“Please, wait for me, my King…”</p><br>
                    <p>As the Black vanished, the White looked up at the sky, watching as a meteor shower streaked across the heavens. With a solemn nod, she prepared herself for what was to come.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="6">
                    <div class="page">6</div>
                    <p>She reached out, her hands glowing with celestial light. Slowly, she compressed her divine form, condensing her immense power into a smaller, human body. Her wings, once vast and powerful, shifted into delicate forms—five pairs of wings, alternating in black and white, now small and graceful. <br>Her crown-like aura swirled and melted into a more human form, though still radiating with divine energy. Her new body, now human in appearance, was beautiful and elegant—her hair silver-white, her eyes a deep, penetrating purple. <br>With a sigh, she looked at her reflection in the mirror that appeared before her. A soft smile touched her lips.
                    </p><br>
                    <p><b>The White (murmuring):</b>“With this form, my love will surely be pleased…”
                    </p><br>
                    <p>After a brief pause, she focused on the coordinates of The Black, finding his location across the realms. A surge of magic rippled through her as she prepared a teleportation spell. Her wings and divine aura retracted into her body, leaving behind only a human appearance.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="7">
                    <div class="page">7</div>
                    <p>With a final whispered vow, she activated the spell.</p><br>
                    <p><b>The White (determined, with a smile):</b>“I am coming for you, my love. Just you wait for me…”</p><br>
                    <p>The air around her shimmered, and in a flash of light, she was gone, her path now set to find The Black in this new world.</p>
