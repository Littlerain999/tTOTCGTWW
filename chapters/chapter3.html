                    <p><i>Two Days Before Elias's Birth</i></p><br>
                    <p>100km away from the Kingdom of Eryndor, in a dark dungeon, a battle was unfolding. Monsters' heads flew as they were effortlessly cut down by a simple yet elegant sword. The bearer of the sword, a mysterious woman in a white robe, moved with precision and grace, slaying countless monsters. Despite being alone, her powerful aura made the monsters hesitate and step back.</p><br>
                    <p>The dungeon's commander, a massive orc, observed the carnage, munching on a severed human child's hand. As he sensed the shift in the woman's aura—calm yet carrying a killing intent—he instinctively reached for his war axe. The woman took a step forward but suddenly felt an unease. She paused, trying to understand the source of her discomfort.</p><br>
                    <p>"What's this feeling of uneasiness? Is it the Orc? No, too weak…" she wondered, but before she could contemplate further, the hand of a cyclops burst through the wall, sending debris flying.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="2">
                    <div class="page">2</div>
                    <p>In shock, the woman shouted, "TIME ACCELERA!" The surrounding area became engulfed in smoke from the destruction. From the shadow, a massive cyclops emerged, searching for her. The orc trembled in fear at the presence of a higher-ranking monster. The other smaller monsters quickly fled, including the orc.</p>
                    <p>"Blessing of Astraxos: HOLY SPEAR!" A beam of light in the form of a spear shot from behind, piercing the cyclops's arm and disintegrating it.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>As the smoke cleared, the woman revealed herself. She had striking Zaffre hair and blue eyes, and she wielded a blade covered in light, emanating a divine aura. With a calm, steady voice, she chanted, "May the gods strengthen me, I offer my prayer to the great God who controls Time and Fate—Chronoros: TIME DECELERATION."</p><br>
                    <p>The cyclops's movements slowed, and the woman, now moving faster due to her own spells, dodged its attacks. Her sword danced through the air, striking the creature with precision. As the battle intensified, she chanted another powerful incantation:</p><br>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="3">
                    <div class="page">3</div>
                    <p>“…With my name, Selene, vowed to protect the innocent… punish the vile… with the holy sword I wield, lend me your strength, Halcyon Flare… holy sword of light, give me your blessing, Lord Astraxos…”</p><br>
                    <p>With the battle nearing its end, Selene dodged the cyclops's final, most powerful attack, positioning herself behind it. Pointing her sword at the creature, she completed her chant: “Divine Light: ANNIHILATION!” The cyclops's upper body was incinerated in an instant.</p><br>
                    <p align="center"><i>The battle was over. </i></p><br>
                    <p>Selene wiped her blade clean with a cloth she found, returned it to its sheath, and donned her robe once again. As she stood, a strange feeling pierced her heart—longing. She was confused, unable to comprehend this new emotion.</p><br>
                    <p>A tear dropped from her eye. "What's happening? Why do I feel like I miss someone... who am I even missing?" Her voice trembled in surprise, as she never experienced such a feeling before.</p><br>

                    <p><i>Two Days Later: The Birth of Elias</i></p><br>
                    <p>On the day Elias was born, Selene felt an unknown pressure from divine energy in the air. She couldn't pinpoint its source, but it was undeniable.</p><br>
                    <p>The next day, she received the news that Lord Aldric's second child had been born. Filled with surprise and joy, she made her way to the Feralden mansion. The journey took her three days.</p><br>
                    <p>Finally, Selene arrived at the mansion. “It hasn't changed one bit. Quite nostalgic…” she murmured, admiring the familiar structure. But something felt off—a strange energy surrounded the mansion, sparking curiosity in her.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>After waiting for the guards to deliver her arrival message to Lord Aldric, he and Lady Mirena came out to meet her. At first, they didn't recognize her due to her hooded robe. Slowly, she removed the hood, revealing her face, and with a sweet smile, said, “I'm back! Mom! Dad!” She bowed respectfully, and as she rose, Lady Mirena ran to her, hugging her tightly.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="5">
                    <div class="page">5</div>
                    <p>“Why did you leave us?!” Lady Mirena scolded through her tears. “Welcome back, Selene,” Lord Aldric said warmly, his voice cracking with emotion.</p><br>
                    <p>Selene, overwhelmed with joy, broke down in tears. She apologized and hugged Lady Mirena tightly, both women sharing a moment of emotional reunion. Lord Aldric watched them, shedding a single tear.</p><br>
                    <p><i>Unseen by Them</i></p><br>
                    <p>Above them, hidden in the sky, Yue observed the scene, her presence concealed. Standing with wings that alternated between black and white, she smirked. “Interesting…” she said, her deep purple eyes sparkling with curiosity. With her analytical abilities, she noted something unusual—Selene possessed the legendary “Time Eye,” a skill that allowed the user to peer into both the past and the future, seeing events that had or would occur.</p><br>
                    <p>As dawn broke, the entire family, including Selene, gathered in Elias's room. When Selene's eyes met Elias's, a shiver ran down her spine.</p>

                <div class="content" id="6">
                    <div class="page">6</div>
                    <p>“What…?” she thought, the same feeling of longing resurfacing. A tear slipped down her cheek.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>“Selene? What's wrong?” Lady Mirena asked, her voice filled with concern.</p><br>
                    <p>“Nothing… nothing, Mother…” Selene said quickly, wiping her eyes. “Hehe,” she chuckled, hiding her emotions. “I'll take a breather in the yard.”</p><br>
                    <p>She rushed out of the room, her chest aching. “What is this feeling? Why does it hurt so much?” she asked herself. Looking at Elias, she muttered, “That child… my little brother…”
                    </p><br>
                    <p>With a determined face, she shook off the uncertainty. “I'll protect him and train him to become a fine young man.”</p><br>
                    <p>Yue, still observing from above, narrowed her eyes. “She… She is the reincarnation of the woman who loved my Lord in my final life…” she mused, a smirk curling on her lips as she continued to analyze the situation.</p><br>
