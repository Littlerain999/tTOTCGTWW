                <div class="content" id="1">
                    <div class="page">1</div>
                    <p>The night after Selene reached Lord Aldric's mansion, it was the night of the full moon in Eryndor, where every living creature of the night had gone to slumber, and the nocturnal beings roamed freely. In the fields of the kingdom, fireflies shone and danced happily around, their light flickering like stars scattered across the earth. The night was quiet and calm, yet it held a breathtaking beauty that only a full moon could bring.</p><br>
                    <p>In the high walls surrounding Eryndor, a maiden with ruby eyes and hair as white as the snow stood beneath the pale light. She stretched her arms outward, as though reaching for the very heavens themselves. And then, as if the moon itself whispered a secret to her soul, she began to move.</p><br>
                    <p>With the grace of a celestial being, she danced. Each movement was a perfect reflection of the night itself—fluid and harmonious, as if her body was woven from the fabric of the stars. Her feet barely touched the ground as she spun, her white hair swirling around her like snow caught in a gentle wind. The air shimmered around her, bending to her rhythm, and the moonlight wrapped her in an ethereal glow, making her seem like an angel descending from the heavens.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="2">
                    <div class="page">2</div>
                    <p> For hours, she danced without stopping, her movements transcending time and space.</p><br>
                    <p>The people of the kingdom, finishing their nightly duties, began to make their way home, but many were stopped in their tracks by the sight of the maiden. Their hearts froze in awe as they witnessed the most mesmerizing spectacle they had ever seen—this mysterious dancer, lost in the full moon's light. Her movements were like a prayer, her body an extension of the world itself, as though she were communing with the heavens. None could understand who she was, for they did not recognize her face, only the beauty of her soul that shone brighter than the moon.</p><br>
                    <p>The watchers stood there, lost in the moment, unable to tear their eyes away from the vision unfolding before them. Hours passed, but no one seemed to notice the passing time. The maiden's dance carried on, as if it would never end, her feet gliding across the stone walls with the elegance of a dream. The kingdom held its breath as she twirled and spun, the pale light of the moon following her every move. But even the most beautiful dance must eventually come to an end.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="3">
                    <div class="page">3</div>
                    <p>As the night deepened, the maiden's movements slowed. Her body, though graceful, seemed to bear the weight of something unseen, something heavy that made her dance falter. With a final, lingering step, she stopped. Her ruby eyes turned upwards, gazing at the starry sky as though seeking solace from the vastness above. Her eyes sparkled with the reflection of the moon, but there was an unmistakable sadness in them—an old sorrow, as if she had lived many lifetimes in the span of a single moment.</p><br>
                    <p>She stood still, her arms reaching toward the sky, her breath trembling. Then, in an instant, she released herself. The air around her seemed to hold its breath as she fell. Her body, once light and free, descended from the walls like a fragile leaf caught in the autumn breeze. The watchers gasped in horror, their eyes wide with disbelief as she fell. But the maiden did not fear her fall—there was only acceptance in her eyes, an understanding that this was her final dance.</p><br>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="4">
                    <div class="page">4</div>
                    <p>The ground came closer, and with a soft, almost delicate impact, she hit the earth. A gasp of pain escaped her lips, her face a mixture of regret and peace. She lay still, her ruby eyes slowly dimming, the light fading from them as the world around her grew colder. A single tear fell down her cheek, as though the heavens themselves wept for her. And with that, the life in her eyes was gone, the silence of the night swallowing her whole.</p><br>
                    <p>The sky, once bright and dazzling, grew dark as thick clouds rolled in, hiding the moon's light. The watchers, still in shock, slowly approached the fallen maiden. It was then that they realized who she was.</p>
                    <p align="center"><b><i>Isabella Nocturne. The Noble's daughter. The cursed child.</i></b></p><br>
                    <p>A name that had been whispered with disdain in the kingdom, the daughter of the noble family who had fallen victim to the curse of Balthor and Oceiros. A family that had wronged the gods, and in return, had cursed their bloodline. Isabella, the one they had mocked, the one they had called a "curse"—and yet, here she lay, lifeless beneath the cold sky.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="5">
                    <div class="page">5</div>
                    <p>The watchers, their hearts heavy with guilt and sorrow, turned and walked away. They could not bring themselves to stay. Fear crept into their hearts as they realized the identity of the girl they had just witnessed—one they had never truly understood. They left as though nothing had happened, their minds racing to erase the memory, for fear of being blamed for her death.</p><br>
                    <p>The clouds above began to weep, and the rain began to fall, as though the heavens, too, mourned the loss of this young soul. The kingdom, once filled with the light of her dance, now stood in silence, heavy with grief.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>"What a sad ending..." A voice spoke from the heavens, a voice that could only belong to Yue. From her vantage point high above, she watched the scene unfold, her heart filled with sorrow for the maiden who had suffered so much.</p><br>
                    <p>"Why is she hated so much?" Yue whispered, a deep pity in her voice. She hovered in the sky, looking down upon the lifeless body of Isabella, her heart aching for the girl who had known nothing but pain.</p><br>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="6">
                    <div class="page">6</div>
                    <p>"She is just an ordinary girl," Yue continued softly, shaking her head as she denied the cruel rumors that had followed Isabella through her life.</p><br>
                    <p>She descended from the sky, her black cloak fluttering around her, her mask hiding her face. As she approached the lifeless form of Isabella, her heart swelled with grief. Before she could do anything, she heard a voice—a nobleman's voice—approaching.</p><br>
                    <p>"Huh?! Is this the place?" The voice was filled with mockery, and Yue quickly concealed herself behind the nearby barrels.</p><br>
                    <p>The noble approached the body, laughing cruelly. "So... HaHa. The cursed girl is now dead. What a miracle this is!? You may be a cursed child, but you were quite stunning as well. Isabella Nocturne," he mocked, his laughter ringing in the air like a bell of cruelty.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Yue's eyes narrowed with disgust. "What a despicable child..." she murmured, her voice calm but tinged with irritation.</p><br>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="7">
                    <div class="page">7</div>
                    <p>The noble turned to give orders. "Now!? Bring the Blood Mage!" he commanded.</p><br>
                    <p>A mage appeared from the shadows, bowing slightly. "What's your wish, Sire?"</p><br>
                    <p>"Make this girl my puppet," the noble said, his face twisted into a perverted grin.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>The mage hesitated, his eyes lingering on Isabella's tear-streaked face. "As you wish, Sire..." he said reluctantly, his voice filled with regret.</p><br>
                    <p>"What's taking so long?!" the noble shouted impatiently.</p><br>
                    <p>Before the mage could complete the ritual, Yue stepped into the scene, her presence commanding attention. The noble froze, glaring at her with fury. "Who are you?!" he demanded. "You dare disturb me?!"</p><br>
                    <p>
                        Yue stood tall, her voice calm and measured, though every word held an icy edge. "What are you going to do with that poor child's body?"
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="8">
                    <div class="page">8</div>
                    <p>The noble sneered. "Of course, I'm going to make her my slave, and use her however I want!" He laughed, his tone dripping with malice.</p><br>
                    <p>Without a word, Yue snapped her fingers, and in an instant, the noble's voice was silenced. He opened his mouth, but no sound escaped. His face contorted in confusion and anger as he realized what had happened.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>"What have you done to our lord?!" The guards, ready to arrest Yue, shouted, their hands on their weapons.</p><br>
                    <p>Yue turned to them, her voice steady and unyielding. "Child, do you still wish to serve this despicable human?"</p><br>
                    <p>The guards laughed, their eyes glinting with malice. "Of course, woman! After all, after we arrest you, you're going to be our plaything," they mocked.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Yue turned her gaze to the mage, her eyes softening. "And you? Are you with them too?"</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="9">
                    <div class="page">9</div>
                    <p>The mage shook his head, his voice filled with sorrow. "I am just a man who needs money for my granddaughter's cure. I do not wish for such things, but I am forced to do this because of my circumstances."</p><br>
                    <p>Yue's eyes softened even more as she reached into her cloak, pulling out a pouch of gold. "Then take this. For now, leave. Run far away from here," she said gently.</p><br>
                    <p>"But..." the mage hesitated, his heart torn.</p><br>
                    <p>"Go," Yue insisted. And with a final look at Isabella, the old mage fled.</p><br>
                    <p>The noble, enraged, shouted, "Guards! Chase after him!"
                    </p><br>
                    <p>But before the guards could move, they were blocked by an invisible barrier, a wall of air that seemed to push them back.</p><br>
                    <p>"You!" the noble yelled, pointing at Yue. "You did this! Guards, arrest her!"</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="10">
                    <div class="page">10</div>
                    <p>In the blink of an eye, the noble and his guards were consumed by darkness. The world around them shifted, and they found themselves trapped in a place with no light. From the shadows, they were pulled by an unknown force, dragged deeper into the abyss, their screams echoing in the dark as their bones cracked and their flesh tore. Yet, no matter how many times they were broken, they did not die. They remained trapped in an eternal cycle of pain and torment, caught in the unyielding grasp of their own punishment.</p><br>
                    <p>Yue, her face unreadable, whispered, "Eternal Prison. Let's call it that." She held Isabella's lifeless body close, her heart heavy with sorrow. "If it were my lord, he would have kept her and given her the happy life she deserved," she whispered, her voice softening into a rare smile as she rose into the sky, carrying the girl's body with her.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="11">
                    <div class="page">11</div>
                    <p>The next morning, word spread across the kingdom of the mysterious disappearance of Isabella Nocturne and the nobleman. Lord Aldric, troubled by the events, increased the security around his mansion, assigning Selene to guard Elias. The kingdom, though unaware of the full extent of what had happened, was forever changed by the tragic and beautiful soul who had danced under the moonlight and left the world forever.</p>

                    <p>She descended from the sky, her black cloak fluttering around her, her mask hiding her face. As she approached the lifeless form of Isabella, her heart swelled with grief. Before she could do anything, she heard a voice—a nobleman's voice—approaching.</p><br>
                    <p>"Huh?! Is this the place?" The voice was filled with mockery, and Yue quickly concealed herself behind the nearby barrels.</p><br>
                    <p>The noble approached the body, laughing cruelly. "So... HaHa. The cursed girl is now dead. What a miracle this is!? You may be a cursed child, but you were quite stunning as well. Isabella Nocturne," he mocked, his laughter ringing in the air like a bell of cruelty.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Yue's eyes narrowed with disgust. "What a despicable child..." she murmured, her voice calm but tinged with irritation.</p><br>

                    <p>The noble turned to give orders. "Now!? Bring the Blood Mage!" he commanded.</p><br>
                    <p>A mage appeared from the shadows, bowing slightly. "What's your wish, Sire?"</p><br>
                    <p>"Make this girl my puppet," the noble said, his face twisted into a perverted grin.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>The mage hesitated, his eyes lingering on Isabella's tear-streaked face. "As you wish, Sire..." he said reluctantly, his voice filled with regret.</p><br>
                    <p>"What's taking so long?!" the noble shouted impatiently.</p><br>
                    <p>Before the mage could complete the ritual, Yue stepped into the scene, her presence commanding attention. The noble froze, glaring at her with fury. "Who are you?!" he demanded. "You dare disturb me?!"</p><br>
                    <p>
                        Yue stood tall, her voice calm and measured, though every word held an icy edge. "What are you going to do with that poor child's body?"
                    </p>

                    <p>The noble sneered. "Of course, I'm going to make her my slave, and use her however I want!" He laughed, his tone dripping with malice.</p><br>
                    <p>Without a word, Yue snapped her fingers, and in an instant, the noble's voice was silenced. He opened his mouth, but no sound escaped. His face contorted in confusion and anger as he realized what had happened.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>"What have you done to our lord?!" The guards, ready to arrest Yue, shouted, their hands on their weapons.</p><br>
                    <p>Yue turned to them, her voice steady and unyielding. "Child, do you still wish to serve this despicable human?"</p><br>
                    <p>The guards laughed, their eyes glinting with malice. "Of course, woman! After all, after we arrest you, you're going to be our plaything," they mocked.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Yue turned her gaze to the mage, her eyes softening. "And you? Are you with them too?"</p>

                <div class="content" id="9">
                    <div class="page">9</div>
                    <p>The mage shook his head, his voice filled with sorrow. "I am just a man who needs money for my granddaughter's cure. I do not wish for such things, but I am forced to do this because of my circumstances."</p><br>
                    <p>Yue's eyes softened even more as she reached into her cloak, pulling out a pouch of gold. "Then take this. For now, leave. Run far away from here," she said gently.</p><br>
                    <p>"But..." the mage hesitated, his heart torn.</p><br>
                    <p>"Go," Yue insisted. And with a final look at Isabella, the old mage fled.</p><br>
                    <p>The noble, enraged, shouted, "Guards! Chase after him!"
                    </p><br>
                    <p>But before the guards could move, they were blocked by an invisible barrier, a wall of air that seemed to push them back.</p><br>
                    <p>"You!" the noble yelled, pointing at Yue. "You did this! Guards, arrest her!"</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content" id="10">
                    <div class="page">10</div>
                    <p>In the blink of an eye, the noble and his guards were consumed by darkness. The world around them shifted, and they found themselves trapped in a place with no light. From the shadows, they were pulled by an unknown force, dragged deeper into the abyss, their screams echoing in the dark as their bones cracked and their flesh tore. Yet, no matter how many times they were broken, they did not die. They remained trapped in an eternal cycle of pain and torment, caught in the unyielding grasp of their own punishment.</p><br>
                    <p>Yue, her face unreadable, whispered, "Eternal Prison. Let's call it that." She held Isabella's lifeless body close, her heart heavy with sorrow. "If it were my lord, he would have kept her and given her the happy life she deserved," she whispered, her voice softening into a rare smile as she rose into the sky, carrying the girl's body with her.</p>

                    <p>The next morning, word spread across the kingdom of the mysterious disappearance of Isabella Nocturne and the nobleman. Lord Aldric, troubled by the events, increased the security around his mansion, assigning Selene to guard Elias. The kingdom, though unaware of the full extent of what had happened, was forever changed by the tragic and beautiful soul who had danced under the moonlight and left the world forever.</p>
